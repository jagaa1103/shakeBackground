# shakeBackground

How can I read motion sensor and detecting shake when app is running in backgroud.

I tried many sources and examples. But I can't find effiecent way. So I decide one thing. It's using location in background mode. 

This way is not good and efficient programming. But I haven't other way. 

If you use this source....
You need to check backround mode settings in your project. (you need to turn on audio and location in background mode)
